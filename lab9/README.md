OOP Style :
-> In oop style for ordering different types of coffees, we have to make new abstract classes and interfaces for every functionality you
have to add

For the same problem in Functional style 
-> Instead of creating separate class for every implementation , coffemaker takes responsibility  to take variety of addons and reduce to
one.
-> Adding imperative style to OOP approaches makes code more elegant and organized
